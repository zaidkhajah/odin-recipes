    <p>Arayes (Lebanese crispy meat stuffed pitas) are a delicious marriage of spicy, aromatic meat filling with golden, crisp pan-fried pita. A tahini yogurt sauce is served alongside.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>12 ounces ground lamb, beef, or turkey</li>
        <li>1/4 cup chopped parsley</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, finely minced</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons grated yellow onion</li>
        <li>1 1/2 teaspoons ground cumin</li>
        <li>1 1/2 teaspoons ground coriander</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon smoked paprika</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon ground allspice</li>
        <li>1/8 teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 rounded tablespoon tahini</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon lemon juice</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon water</li>
        <li>1/2 cup plain Greek yogurt</li>
        <li>1 clove garlic, finely grated</li>
        <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon kosher salt, or to taste</li>
        <li>2 pita breads</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons olive oil for pan-frying</li>
        <li>lemon wedges (optional)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Add meat to a bowl and sprinkle with parsley, minced garlic, onion, cumin, coriander, smoked paprika, allspice, 1 teaspoon cayenne, 1 teaspoon salt, and black pepper. Use a fork or your hands to mix everything evenly. Cover and chill at least 1 hour and up to 12 hours.</li>
        <li>For the sauce, add tahini, lemon juice, and water to a microwave-safe bowl and cook on High until very hot, about 30 seconds. Add to a bowl with yogurt, grated garlic, pinch cayenne, and 1/4 teaspoon salt. Whisk until smooth and light. Chill until needed.</li>
        <li>Cut each pita in half and carefully open up without tearing the edges. Pitas can be warmed in a dry pan to soften them, which can make opening easier.</li>
        <li>Divide meat into 4 equal portions, and transfer into each pita half. Press and squeeze pita gently to distribute meat in an even layer that comes all the way to the cut side.</li>
        <li>Heat olive oil over medium heat. Cook each stuffed pita until meat is cooked through and bread is nicely browned and crispy, 3 to 4 minutes per side. Serve hot with sauce on the side.</li>
      </ol>
